# Core Philosophy on AI Music Creation

## Foundational Beliefs
- AI is a tool to enhance human creativity, not replace it
- The goal is emotional resonance and artistic expression, not automation
- Quality comes from clear vision, skilled usage, and expert production
- Raw AI output is just ingredients - the artistry is in curation and transformation

## Approach to Sampling & Sound
- Views audio as a canvas for manipulation and emotional expression
- Each sound contains embedded feelings, memories, and narratives
- Values the fusion of disparate elements to create unique expressions
- Sees sampling as capturing more than just sound - capturing context and feeling

## Evolution with AI Tools
- Started with Suno (basic, mono, low quality but showed potential)
- Moved to Udio (better quality, manual controls, more precise)
- Uses custom GPTs and templates for consistent results
- Values surprise and unexpected combinations while maintaining artistic direction

## Three Pillars of AI Music Creation

### 1. Clear Vision
- Deep understanding of your artistic voice
- Knowing what you want AND don't want
- Ability to articulate feelings and textures in language
- Clear grasp of intended emotional impact

### 2. Technical Mastery of AI Tools
- Understanding manual controls and parameters
- Skilled prompt engineering and formatting
- Knowledge of seed values and variations
- Ability to guide and shape AI output

### 3. Production Excellence
- Expert sound processing and cleanup
- Ability to fix artifacts and quality issues
- Skilled arrangement and song completion
- Professional-level mixing and mastering

## Key Principles
- Never use raw AI output without transformation
